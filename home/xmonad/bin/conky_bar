#!/usr/bin/conky
# The **`home/xmonad/bin/conky_bar`** file contains the definition of the
# conky information that will be piped to the dzen bar that is drawn at the
# top right of the screen.

# ## Configuration

# The `background` variable forces conky to daemonize itself to the background
# once it's launched.
background yes

# The `double_buffer` variable asks conky to use the Xdbe extension to reduce
# flicker. This probably isn't required anymore.
double_buffer yes 

# `out_to_console` simply tells conky to print to stdout, which is necessary here
# because we are piping the output to dzen.
out_to_console yes 

# `own_window` tells conky to draw its own window.
own_window yes

# `own_window_type` tells conky to draw the window in such a way as to always be
# visible at the lowest layer (i.e. the desktop) and to not use any window
# decorations. This option combined with the XMonad struts layout option
# provide the appearance of a standard panel/taskbar.
own_window_type desktop

# `update_interval` is how frequently in seconds conky should re-output the content.
update_interval 1

# `font` is self-explanatory. One can use xfontsel to pick a font.
font -*-clean-*-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-*

# `alignment` indicates the vertical and horizontal alignment of the text. `mr`
# indicates vertically centered and horizontally right-aligned.
alignment mr

# ## Contents

# The following are commented on all at once because conky does not allow
# unprinted comments after the `TEXT` declaration.
#
# The `TEXT` declaration begins the contents of what actually prints to the
# screen. Newlines are preserved, so all lines here end with a backslash to
# draw on one line while maintaining the readability of this file.
#
# There are four pieces of information displayed, each separated by a pipe ("|"):
# the CPU load, the percent of memory in use (less buffer), the current CPU 
# temperature, and a battery percentage indicator with either a charging or
# discharging icon.
